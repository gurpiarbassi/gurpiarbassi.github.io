#Motivation
I'm getting sick and tired of how slow ubuntu has become over the years. With the introduction of the Unity desktop, finding and launching applications has become very tedious.

##dmenu
A friend of mine introduced me to dmenu, a lightweight dynamic menu manager for X.
To install:

sudo apt-get install dmenu

Then go into keyboard and create new shortcut.
name: dmenu
command: dmenu_run

Then click on the shortcut so the state changes to 'new accelerator'.

Then type in your desired shortcut.
